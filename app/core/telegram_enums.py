"""Compatibility shims for Telegram enums used across the codebase.

Historically these enums lived in ``app.core``. They were moved to
``app.models.telegram`` as part of the modular refactor, but several tests and
legacy imports still reference the old location. This module re-exports the
current definitions to preserve backwards compatibility.
