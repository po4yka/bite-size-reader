  "input_snippet": "Three years after the great remote work experiment began, I believe we have enough evidence to declare that fully remote work is not the utopia its proponents promised. While flexibility has its merits, the erosion of spontaneous collaboration, mentorship, and company culture cannot be ignored...",
  "expected_output": {
    "summary_250": "An editorial argues that fully remote work has undermined collaboration and mentorship, proposing hybrid models as the pragmatic middle ground after three years of evidence.",
    "summary_1000": "The author contends that three years of remote work data reveal significant downsides that early enthusiasm overlooked. Spontaneous hallway conversations, which historically drove cross-team innovation, have declined sharply. Junior employees report feeling isolated and lacking the informal mentorship that in-office proximity provides. However, the piece acknowledges that commute elimination and schedule flexibility represent genuine worker gains. The editorial concludes that hybrid arrangements offering 2-3 office days per week balance productivity, culture, and employee satisfaction most effectively.",
    "tldr": "This editorial takes stock of three years of widespread remote work and argues that the fully remote model falls short of its promise.\n\nWhile acknowledging real benefits like eliminated commutes and greater schedule autonomy, the author presents evidence that remote-first cultures suffer from reduced spontaneous collaboration, weaker mentorship pipelines for junior staff, and eroding company culture. Internal surveys from multiple firms show declining engagement scores and rising turnover among employees under 30.\n\nThe piece advocates for structured hybrid models with 2-3 mandatory office days per week, citing companies like Salesforce and Dropbox as successful case studies. The author warns that companies clinging to fully remote policies risk long-term talent development gaps.",
