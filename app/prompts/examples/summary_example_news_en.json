    "summary_1000": "The European Union has enacted the Digital Markets Act (DMA), set to take effect in March, targeting major technology platforms with more than 45 million EU users. The regulation mandates strict interoperability requirements, forcing messaging platforms to work with competitors. Companies must also enable data portability, allowing users to transfer their data seamlessly. Non-compliance carries fines up to 10% of global annual revenue.

    "tldr": "The European Union is implementing its most comprehensive tech regulation to date with the Digital Markets Act (DMA), effective March.\n\nMajor platforms (45M+ EU users) must comply with interoperability mandates, meaning messaging apps like WhatsApp must communicate with Signal or Telegram. Data portability rules require platforms to let users export and transfer their information freely.\n\nPenalties for violations reach 10% of global annual revenue—potentially billions for the largest companies. Apple, Google, Meta, and Amazon face the most significant compliance burdens. Industry experts expect the regulation to reshape platform business models across Europe.",
