  "input_snippet": "At Stripe, we believe that the best engineering cultures are built on writing. Not just code, but documents, proposals, and post-mortems. When engineers write well, they think more clearly, communicate more effectively, and build better systems. Here's how our culture of writing has shaped the way we build software...",

    "summary_250": "Stripe's engineering blog explains how a writing-first culture drives clearer thinking, better communication, and stronger software systems across engineering teams.",
    "summary_1000": "Stripe's engineering team attributes much of its technical culture to a deliberate emphasis on writing. Engineers write design documents before coding, post-mortems after incidents, and weekly status updates that force structured reflection. The practice improves decision quality by requiring authors to think through edge cases and trade-offs on paper. Cross-team knowledge sharing happens through an internal document repository that anyone can search and comment on. New engineers onboard faster because institutional knowledge is written rather than locked in people's heads.",
    "tldr": "This blog post from Stripe's engineering team describes how writing is a core pillar of their technical culture and why they believe it produces better software.\n\nDesign documents precede all significant engineering work. Engineers must articulate the problem, proposed solution, alternatives considered, and risks in writing before any code is written. This process catches misunderstandings early and creates a durable record of decision rationale. Post-mortems follow a blameless template that captures timeline, root cause, contributing factors, and action items.\n\nThe company maintains a searchable internal repository of all documents, enabling cross-team discovery. Weekly engineering updates force structured self-reflection and surface blockers quickly. New hires consistently report that the document culture accelerated their onboarding because institutional knowledge was explicit and accessible rather than tribal.",
