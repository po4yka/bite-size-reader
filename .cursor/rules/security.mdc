# Security Guidelines

- Do not hardcode API keys, tokens, or secrets in source code or config files.
- Store sensitive data in environment variables or secure vaults.
- Validate any URLs or message content from users to prevent injection attacks.
- Limit the botâ€™s permissions and exposure; it is for personal use only.
- Avoid logging sensitive data; redact if necessary.
- Use latest dependency versions with security patches.
- Regularly review dependencies for vulnerabilities.
