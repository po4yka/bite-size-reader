# Security Guidelines

- Never hardcode API keys, tokens, or secrets; load them from environment variables only and do not persist them in logs/DB.
- Enforce owner-only access via `ALLOWED_USER_IDS`; validate and normalize URLs before processing to avoid injection.
- Redact `Authorization` and other sensitive headers before logging; include correlation IDs for traceability.
- Avoid PII storage; keep SQLite DB and `/data` artifacts private to the container/host.
- Keep dependencies patched; scan for vulnerabilities and rotate credentials if compromise is suspected.
