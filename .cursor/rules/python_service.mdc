# Python Service Coding Guidelines

- Use async/await syntax for all I/O and network calls.
- Modularize concerns: separate bot client, parser, API client, and DB layers.
- Use type hints and docstrings on all public functions/classes.
- Follow PEP8 style conventions strictly.
- Gracefully handle errors with retries for transient API failures (Firecrawl, OpenRouter).
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs before processing.
- Use environment variables for sensitive API keys and endpoints.
- Write unit tests and integration tests with mocked external APIs.
- Log important events including API call success/failure.
