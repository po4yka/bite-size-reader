# Docker Container Guidelines

- Use official Python base images with appropriate tags (e.g. python:3.11-slim).
- Minimize image layer size by cleaning cache and unnecessary files.
- Use multi-stage builds if needed to separate build/dependency and runtime layers.
- Pass secrets like API keys as environment variables, never baked into image.
- Expose only necessary ports and restrict to localhost if possible.
- Use persistent volumes or bind mounts for SQLite database files.
- Document Docker build and run instructions clearly.
- Keep Dockerfile simple and readable.
